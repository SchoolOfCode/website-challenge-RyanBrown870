# Website Challenge

## Overview

This is a profile webpage for a fellow developer on the School of Code Flexible Bootcamp.

## Development Process

Design preferences were discussed with the client and overall content that would be included on the page. I had a good idea of the structure I wanted for the page after getting inspiration online and coded some comment to-do lists to make sure I remembered the plan.

Paired programming for troubleshooting and general best practice and sharing of ideas. As a three, we spent a lot of time on video calls where we each shared our screen for extended periods so while people were working on their own coding, you could take a break and just look over at what the other guys were coding/reading. We then just spoke up when we needed help or wanted to ask questions.

The implementation of a responsive mobile first page was done in a pair programming session and Jordan led me through the menu dropdown button creation in the `<nav>` bar for mobile screens.

## Research Undertaken

Discussed on video calls preferences and design choices over Slack. Jordan wanted blue colours for the theme and to highlight some of his interests including cinema, jet-skiing and travelling.

## Decision Making Process

The initial decision making came from the client in terms of needs for the page and general design choices such as colour themes. I then proposed a layout and made simple placeholder boxes to show how this would look and then the client gave an opinion on these. Whilst the client wanted a blue theme, I thought a two-tone theme including blue worked better aesthetically and so implemented this and made the case that this would look more visually appealing. The client agreed with my reasoning and so this design remained.

Generally I took the approach of check first, then code to avoid wasting too much time making something that wouldn't work for the client or wasn't to their taste. Ultimately, I think the decisions were down to me as a developer to anticipate the preferences and of the client and balance those against what I thought would work best for the page in terms of achieving the client's goal of making a profile page that users will want to look at and spend time with.
